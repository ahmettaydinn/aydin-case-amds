# PROJECT : Amadeus Case

As a JS library project ui runs on react and react-dom. Project is coded with typescript. Various
3rd party packages installed for better user experience and professional UI. These packages are high-level
but tiresome to configure. Necessary research and previous took part in this process. As a basic CI github workflow
is added to run in github actions.

## Table of contents

In terms of seperation of concerns reusable components and folder structure is used.
'db.json' in the root of the project stands for database.

## How to run the project

- do not forget to run the db before runing application!
- run "yarn dev" to start the local server. Project runs on http://localhost:5173/
- run "json-server --watch db.json --delay 250". Mock Database runs on http://localhost:3000/ (delay is necessary to see the loading)
- There are not available tickets to satisfy all airports. I created 19 tickets to be searched. Please check them in inital render in
  which displays all tickets!

## Mock Api

- I used [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) as mock-api. I request locally to the server.
- All filtering, sorting process happen on the backend. Frontend is only responsible of UI
- Some of the data are generated by AI and some of them are generated tailor made to keep up with consistency.

- for Airports: "http://localhost:3000/airports"
- for Ticket: "http://localhost:3000/tickets"

#### Ticket queries are? :

    1. departure_airport=IST&arrival_airport=ADB
    2. departureTime_gte=2024-1-24&departureTime_lte=2025-4-2
    3. _sort=price&_order=desc

## Type Safety

Throughout the project Typescript is preferred over Javascript due to some reasons. These reasons are prevent errors beforehand and keep code more consistent and scalable. When needed advance typescript features such as generics are researched and use. The way is typescript used in this project is very dynamic and reusable. Another folder called types is created exactly for this reason.

## Libraries-Tools

- Material UI for UI
- json-server for mock api
- React Query and Axios for API requests
- React Hook Form for form building
- dayjs for date calculation
- react testing library
- react-toastify for error throwing

|----types
|----utils
|----asset

```

## Validation Mechanism

All form fields are validated. In case of wrong input or empty required fields user is warned and forwarded with toast messages. Autocomplete and Date picker is used for forms. Chekboxes are structurd as align.

Validations Instances:

1. Return Date can not be before than departure date
2. Any date can not be before than today
3. All required fields must be filled
4. Two checkboxes cannot be selected at same time
